My sample task solutions from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### Task 1
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

#### Examples

"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"<br>
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"

#### Examples

Input: 21445 Output: 54421<br>
Input: 145263 Output: 654321<br>
Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321<br>

### Task 3
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

#### Examples

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]<br>
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)<br>

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]<br>
Should return: 160 (the only even number)<br>
