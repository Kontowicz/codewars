My sample task solutions from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).

### Task 1
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

#### Examples

"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"<br>
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps"

### Task 2
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

#### Examples

Input: 21445 Output: 54421<br>
Input: 145263 Output: 654321<br>
Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321<br>

### Task 3
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

#### Examples

[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]<br>
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)<br>

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]<br>
Should return: 160 (the only even number)<br>

    - [Python](solutions/python/task_003.py)

### Task 4
Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

#### Examples

Input: [[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]<br>
Output: ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]<br>


- Solution
    - [Python](solutions/python/task_004.py)

### Task 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

#### Examples

Input: 10
Output: 23
